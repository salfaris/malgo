A collection of common math algorithms. We sort according to difficulty, in particular, based on how much theory would be required to understand these algorithms.

### Easy
- Fibonacci sequence
- k-Factorials
- Price discount
- Differentiation (Finite difference method)
- Roots (Newton, Secant, Bisection)
- Monte-Carlo integration

### Medium
- Gaussian Elimination
- Basic integration methods (Trapezoidal, Midpoint, Simpson)
- Interpolation (Lagrange)
- Polynomial Fit
- Euler's method

### Hard
- Gaussian Quadrature
