# Math Algorithms

A collection of common math algorithms. We sort according to difficulty, in particular, based on how much theory would be required to understand these algorithms.

### Easy
- Fibonacci sequence
- k-Factorials
- Price discount

### Medium
- Gaussian Elimination
- Integration (Trapezoidal, Midpoint)
